Vehicle Inventory Management System CLI
Problem Statement

Automobile dealerships often face challenges in efficiently managing their vehicle inventory. Outdated information, difficulty in searching for specific vehicles, and a lack of centralized control over inventory can lead to operational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we propose the development of a Vehicle Inventory Management System CLI application. This application will enable dealerships to easily add, update, and search for vehicles based on various criteria, such as make, model, year, and price.
Solution

Our solution is to create a robust Vehicle Inventory Management System CLI application that encompasses the following features to address the problem statement:

    # Add Vehicles: Dealerships can easily add new vehicles to their inventory by providing details such as make, model, year, price, and any additional information.

    # Search Vehicles: The application allows users to search for vehicles based on various criteria, including make, model, year, and price range. This feature ensures that users can quickly locate specific vehicles in their inventory.

   # Data Integrity: The application maintains data integrity by implementing relationships between tables. This ensures that the data is accurate and consistent.

   # Efficient Operations: With the CLI interface, users can perform operations efficiently, reducing manual effort and operational inefficiencies.
